        <h1>Since the fall of communism in 1989, the nature of migration to and from Poland has been in flux. 
            After Poland's accession to the European Union and accession to the Schengen Area in particular, 
            a significant number of Poles, estimated at over two million, have emigrated, primarily to the United 
            Kingdom, Germany, France and Ireland. The majority of them, according to the Central Statistical 
            Office of Poland, left in search of better work opportunities abroad while retaining permanent resident
             status in Poland itself.

            After Poland joined the EU, Poles acquired the right to work in some EU countries, while some of the
            members implemented transition periods. The UK, Ireland, Sweden and Malta allowed Poles to work freely
            without any limitations from the start. Peaking in 2007, almost 2.3 million Poles lived abroad,
            mostly in Western Europe. This has been the largest wave of economic migration of Poles abroad since
            the Polish emigration to the United States in late 19th and early 20th century, which is estimated
            to have brought between about 1.5 million, and 3.5 million Poles to the United States.</h1>
