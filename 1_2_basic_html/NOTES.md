## NOTES

-----------
INSTRUCTIONS:
Use this markdown file to keep track of open questions/challenges from this week's assignment.
- What did you have trouble solving?
No idea how to insert the rectangles following the example with circles - the rectangles ended up being on top of each other - how do I move them around?
Hard to adjust the sizing of the logo/img without skewing it, just did it with %
- What went easier than expected?
Adding user input and button
- What, if anything, is currently blocking you?

Sometimes it helps to formulate what you understood and where you got stuck in order to move forward. Feel free to include `code snippets`, `screenshots`, and `error message text` here as well.

If you find you're not able complete this week's assignment, reflecting on where you are getting stuck here will help you get full credit for this week's tutorial
