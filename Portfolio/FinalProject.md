# [FINAL PROJECT](https://agilarowski.github.io/Interactive-Data-Vis-Fall2022/FINAL_PROJECT_DATAVIS/index.html)

## ABSTRACT

In my final project I wanted to visualize the trends in interstate migrations. Specifically, I wanted to see which states have growing populations due to state-to-state migration and how migration patterns look like in each state. Originally, I planned to prepare an interactive map that, after clicking on a state, would show outflows and inflows (dropdown selection) as a color-gradient map. I also planned to include additional information (presidential voting, median house price and media income).

## ANALYSIS

My plan was to analyze patterns by calculating how many migrants moved from republican to democratic states (and vice versa), from states with higher median single house price to states with lower median single house price, etc. After exploring the maps on US Census website, I decided to prepare more of an exploratory visualizations. The economic and political factors would be best applied at a county level as there are significant discrepancies within each state.
