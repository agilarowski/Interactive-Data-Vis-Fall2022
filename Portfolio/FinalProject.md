# FINAL PROJECT

## ABSTRACT

In my final project I wanted to visualize the trends in interstate migrations. Specifically, I wanted to see which states have growing populations due to state-to-state migration and how migration patterns look like in each state. Originally, I planned to prepare an interactive map that, after clicking on a state, would show outflows and inflows (dropdown selection) as a color-gradient map.
