# [FINAL PROJECT](https://agilarowski.github.io/Interactive-Data-Vis-Fall2022/FINAL_PROJECT_DATAVIS/index.html)

## ABSTRACT

In my final project I wanted to visualize the trends in interstate migrations. Specifically, I wanted to see which states have growing populations due to state-to-state migration and how migration patterns look like in each state. Originally, I planned to prepare an interactive map that, after clicking on a state, would show outflows and inflows (dropdown selection) as a color-gradient map. I also planned to include additional information (presidential voting, median house price and media income).
