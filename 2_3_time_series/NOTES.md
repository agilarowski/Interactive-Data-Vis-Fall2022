## NOTES
For this assignment I used the demo code, stock overflow and github (I was trying differt things from many examples, not able to list them) and www.d3noob.org and bl.ocks.org - I was not able to make it work on the demo example and could not figure out my mistakes.

INSTRUCTIONS:
Use this markdown file to keep track of open questions/challenges from this week's assignment.
- What did you have trouble solving?
Positioning svg with margins, height and width following demo example. When I tried I was only getting axis and nothing else.
- What went easier than expected?
- What, if anything, is currently blocking you?

Sometimes it helps to formulate what you understood and where you got stuck in order to move forward. Feel free to include `code snippets`, `screenshots`, and `error message text` here as well.

If you find you're not able complete this week's assignment, reflecting on where you are getting stuck here will help you get full credit for this week's tutorial
