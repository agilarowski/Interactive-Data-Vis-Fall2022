<h1> DATA VIS | Final project </h1>
<body>
    <p>The map below shows state to state net migration values. I used the Census American Community Survey data for July 1, 
       2019 to July 1, 2020 period. On the map, the states marked green have the most newcomers from other states, while in the states colored
       red the populations are shrinking.
        </p>
        <p> You can hover over the states to see the exact number.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>State-to-State net migration 2019-2020</b></p>

        <div id="container"></div>

        <p> From the matrix below you can learn from which states people were moving and where. The number that you see when you
            hover over each cell represents the size of the population that moved out to a specific state in thousands. </p>
